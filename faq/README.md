## ⚡ Quick Reference: Reception Golden Rules
*The most common scenarios encountered at the front desk.*

| Client Asks... | Standard Response Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"How much will it cost?"** | **Don't guess.** Quote the *Diagnostic Fee* first. "Our diagnostic fee is $X. Once we find the issue, we apply that fee toward the final repair cost." |
| **"Can you fix it right now?"** | Check the queue. Usually: "We work on a first-come, first-served basis. Current turnaround is X days, but we offer a Rush Service for an additional fee." |
| **"I just have a quick question for a tech."** | Shield the techs. "The technicians are currently deep in repairs. I can take a message, or start a ticket so they can review your issue properly." |
| **"Is my data safe?"** | Refer to the **[Data Privacy/Waiver](../business/General_Disclaimers.md)**. "We take every precaution, but we always recommend you have a backup before drop-off." |
