---

## 🔧 Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Unbox and Connect the Router
1.  Plug in the router’s **power adapter** and turn it on.
2.  Connect the router to your **modem** using an **Ethernet cable** (from the modem's LAN/Internet port to the router’s **WAN/Internet port**).
3.  If your ISP requires activation, complete that process before proceeding.

### Step 2: Connect to the Router
Establish a temporary connection to the new router to access its settings:
* Use **Wi-Fi** (the default network name and password are usually on a sticker on the router).
* *OR* connect a computer via **Ethernet** to a **LAN port** on the router.

### Step 3: Access the Router’s Setup Page
1.  Open a web browser and enter the router’s **IP address** (common ones include `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`). This is usually listed in the product documentation.
2.  Log in with the **default username and password** (check the router, the router’s label, or the manual).

### Step 4: Run the Setup Wizard
Most modern routers use a setup wizard to guide you through two essential configurations:
* **Internet Setup:** Usually set to **Dynamic IP (DHCP)** unless your ISP provides a static IP or PPPoE credentials.
* **Wi-Fi Setup:** Change the **network name (SSID)** and set a strong Wi-Fi password (use **WPA2** or **WPA3** for best security).

### Step 5: Update Router Firmware
* Navigate to the **Firmware Update** section in the router settings.
* If an update is available, **install it** to improve security and performance.

### Step 6: Adjust Additional Settings (Optional but Recommended)
* **Change Admin Password:** This prevents unauthorized access to the router settings page.
* **Set up Guest Wi-Fi:** Isolates guest devices from your main network.
* **Configure Advanced Settings:** Enable parental controls, configure Port Forwarding, QoS (Quality of Service), or other features as needed.

### Step 7: Reboot & Test Connection 🚀
* Restart the router and modem if prompted.
* Test the connection on multiple devices to ensure everything is working correctly.

Your router is now set up and ready to use!
