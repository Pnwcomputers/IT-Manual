## [Comcast Fiber (Xfinity)](https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/activate-xfi-gateway-app) 🟣 

Comcast/Xfinity Fiber service is typically limited to specific properties (like apartment complexes) and often requires using their provided fiber gateway. The process is similar to their coaxial self-install but with a fiber connection.

---

1.  **Connection:** The Xfinity Fiber Gateway must be connected to the **Optical Network Terminal (ONT)** installed by the technician, usually with an Ethernet cable. The ONT converts the fiber-optic signal to a standard Ethernet signal.
2.  **Power On:** Plug in the Xfinity Gateway and wait for the lights (like **Power**, **US/DS**, and **Online**) to stabilize. This can take up to 10 minutes.
3.  **Activation (Self-Install):**
    * Connect a device to the Gateway's temporary Wi-Fi network (Network Name and Password are on the sticker).
    * Use the **Xfinity App** on your phone to scan the modem and begin the activation process.
    * *OR* Open a web browser on a connected computer. You will be automatically redirected to the Xfinity **Self-Install web portal** to complete the setup.
4.  **Testing:** Once activated, the **Online** light should be solid, and you can test your internet connection.

2.  **Cable Connection:** Run the proprietary cable from the dish to the power supply/router unit.
3.  **Power On:** Plug in the power supply. The dish will automatically orient itself toward the satellites.
4.  **App Configuration:** Download and use the **Starlink Mobile App** to:
    * Check for obstructions.
    * Configure the Wi-Fi network name and password.
    * Monitor system status and performance.

## 🌐 Ziply Fiber (Fiber & DSL)

Ziply Fiber uses an **Optical Network Terminal (ONT)** for fiber service or a direct DSL connection, and then connects to your router/gateway.

### **Fiber Connection (Recommended)** 💡

1.  **Locate the ONT:** Find the Optical Network Terminal (ONT)—a small box, typically white, installed by the technician either inside your home (e.g., in a closet or basement) or outside.
2.  **Connection:** Connect an **Ethernet cable** from the ONT's Ethernet port to the **WAN (or ONT)** port on the Ziply router/gateway.
3.  **Power On:** Plug in the router's power adapter and press the power button (if applicable). Wait for the **Internet** light to turn solid **BLUE** (this may take a few minutes).
4.  **Activation:** Open a web browser on a connected device (via Wi-Fi or another Ethernet cable) and navigate to **ziplyfiber.com/activate** to complete the acceptance of terms and finalize the installation.
    * *Note: If you have a DSL connection, you would instead connect a **DSL phone cord** from the wall jack (often with a filter) to the **DSL port** on the modem/router.*

## ⚛️ Quantum Fiber

Quantum Fiber (formerly CenturyLink Fiber) typically installs a **SmartNID** device, or, in some cases, the fiber connects directly to the gateway/modem. You'll primarily use their mobile app or a web interface for setup.

1.  **Hardware Check:** Ensure the fiber line is connected to the **SmartNID** (if applicable) or the fiber port on the gateway/modem.
2.  **Connection:** Plug the power cord into the Quantum Fiber modem/gateway and into an electrical outlet.
3.  **Power On:** Wait for the status lights to stabilize. The Internet/Status light will turn green when ready.
4.  **Configuration:**
    * **Automatic:** Open a web browser on a connected device. The device may automatically detect and configure the connection. If you have a PPPoE connection, you'll be prompted to enter your Quantum Fiber username and password.
    * **Manual/Admin:** If necessary, navigate to the modem's web interface (usually **http://192.168.0.1**) and log in using the Admin Username and Password found on the sticker on the device to configure the connection.
