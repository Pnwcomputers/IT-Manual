### What to Include in Your Notes:
1.  **Client/Location Details:** Client name, date, time in/out, address, and residency type.
2.  **Work Summary (What was done):** A concise, itemized list of every task completed (e.g., "Start-up Optimized," "Junk file cleanup").
3.  **Findings & Issues:** Any critical discoveries (e.g., "3 PUPs removed," "No backup system found").
4.  **Client Discussion:** What was explained to or discussed with the client (e.g., "Discussed cloud backup options," "Referred to BackBlaze").
