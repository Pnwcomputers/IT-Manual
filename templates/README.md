# 📄 Templates & Standard Responses

**Part of the [IT-Manual](../README.md)**
*Boilerplate text for tickets, invoices, and client communication.*

---

## 📖 Overview
This directory contains the "Copy-Paste" resources for the shop. Using these templates ensures that every client receives the same high level of professional communication, whether they are getting a text message about a pickup or an invoice for a complex server migration.

## 📂 Contents

### 💬 Client Communication
*Scripts for emails, texts, and phone calls.*

- **[SMS & Email Templates](./SMS-Email-Templates.md)**
  **Most Used:** Pre-written messages for common ticket statuses:
  * "Your device is checked in."
  * "We need your password."
  * "Your repair is complete / Ready for pickup."
  * "Parts represent a delay."
- **[Communication](./Communication.md)**
  General guidelines for tone and style. How to explain complex technical issues to non-technical clients without sounding condescending.

### 💰 Billing & Invoicing
*Standardizing how we charge.*

- **[Invoice Templates](./Invoice-Templates.md)**
  Standard wording and line-item descriptions for common services. Use these to ensure "Virus Removal" isn't described five different ways by five different techs.
  * *Includes standard disclaimers for invoices.*

### 📝 Internal Documentation
*How to write ticket notes.*

- **[Notes & Documentation](./Notes-Documentation.md)**
  **Critical for History:** Standards for internal ticket updates. Defines the difference between "Public Notes" (client sees) and "Internal Notes" (staff only), and what details *must* be recorded before closing a ticket.
