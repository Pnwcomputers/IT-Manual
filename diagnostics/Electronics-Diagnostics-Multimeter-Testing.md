Resistors & Inductors Ω
Resistance Mode Ω with Multimeter
If a resistor is closed it will test as a dead short (no resistance)
If a resistor is open, you are not going to get ANY resistance (open)
Check and test if the devices are in series or parallel
Can act like a fuse
Variable Resistors Ω
Resistance Mode Ω with Multimeter
Sweep to measure resistance, or match to set rating
Potentiometers, etc.
Coils (Inductor) ၊၊||၊
2 Terminals = +/-
Test Continuity to make sure it is good
No Continuity means the Coil is BAD
Diodes “One Way Wire” →←
Diode Mode →← with Multimeter
Positive on the “dark” side, and ground on the “white” side to test
Voltage drop measured
Electronics Diagnostics - Multimeter Testing 1
Bridge Rectifier
- Pin A, + Pin B = Measure (Reverse polarity should be 0)
- Pin A, + Pin C = Measure (Reverse polarity should be 0)
+ Pin D, - Pin C = Measure (Reverse polarity should be 0)
+ Pin D, - Pin B = Measure (Reverse polarity should be 0)
Can act like a fuse
Mosfets (Gate, Drain & Source) →←
Diode Mode →← with Multimeter
N Type (NPN)
+ to Drain, - to Source = Increase power to Mosfet to turn OFF
(OL)
Charge the gate by taping it with +
Go back to Drain with + and it should not be on (meter will beep)
Let go and tap Drain with + again and it should now be charging
to OFF like at the start.
P Type (PNP)
Opposite function of N type
4Pin, 6Pin and 8Pin Types of Mosfets
8Pin = 4 Drain, 3 Source, 1 Gate
6Pin = 4 Drain, 1 Source, 1 Gate
4Pin = 1 Base (Gate), 2 Collector (Source), 1 Emitter (Drain)
PIN 1 (Drain) always has a marker - Such as a Dot
Test a Mosfet between Drain and Source
Any continuity means the Mosfet is bad.
Transistors (made up of Diodes) →←
Diode Mode →← with Multimeter
NPN - (BCE; Base Collector Emitter)
Base to Collector or the Other Way Around
Electronics Diagnostics - Multimeter Testing 2
Base to Emitter or the Other Way Around
PNP
Swap method of NPN around
Any continuity means the Transistor is bad.
Capacitors →←
Diode Mode →← with Multimeter
Better/Best: Use an ESR Meter
Match readings to listed rating on Capacitor
Short the +/- to discharge as needed
If a CAP is charged, it’s voltage reading should match rated output
If a cap’s resistance reading is more than 10% difference, replace.
Test Continuity to make sure it is good
Check and test if the devices are in series or parallel
If a capacitor has ZERO/0 continuity means the it is bad/shorted
Capacitors for/under Chips; GPU, CPU etc. Will have a very LOW
resistance and will have continuity.
Switches ၊၊||၊
Continuity Mode ၊၊||၊|။ (Beep) with Multimeter
Should beep when turned on only
Fuses ၊၊||၊
Continuity Mode ၊၊||၊|။ (Beep) with Multimeter
Should beep indicating the Fuse is not blown
Can be a Resistor or even a Diode
No continuity means the fuse is BAD
Integrated Circuits (IC)
Clock Generator IC
Electronics Diagnostics - Multimeter Testing 3
Circuit Diagram Needed
Crystal Oscillator is needed and needs to be functional
Audio IC
Circuit Diagram Needed
RJ45 IC
Circuit Diagram Needed
Super IO
Electronics Diagnostics - Multimeter Testing 4
Circuit Diagram Needed
Basically a big power management IC
Check capacitors around a Super IO, any shorts means the IC is bad
Charge Integrated Circuit (PWM IC)
When testing an IC, if any of it’s capacitors test as shorted, the IC is
shorted and needs to be replaced.
