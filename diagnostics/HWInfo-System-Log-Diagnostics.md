HWInfo - System Log
Diagnostics
Using HWInfo to Log System Issues
If a customer is experiencing issues with their computer but they can't clearly
describe what's happening, or if we've recently performed work on the system
and the customer is encountering problems again after picking up their 
system, HWInfo can help log important system data for troubleshooting,
without the customer having to bring anything in!
If the client is open to it, they can download and install HWInfo onto their
system to generate a system log file that they can send to us for review. This
log file can capture crashes, errors, freezing events, temperature fluctuations,
and other system anomalies!

The goal is to log any crashes or system issues so we can analyze the data
and determine the cause of the problem.
How to Enable Logging in HWInfo (PC)
1.Install and Open HWInfo
👉 Download HWInfo: https://www.hwinfo.com/
Launch HWInfo64 (or HWInfo32 if you're on a 32-bit system).
If prompted, select "Sensors-only" mode and click Run.
2.Open the SensorWindow
If the sensor window doesn’t open automatically, click the Sensors button
(a small graph icon).
3.Enable Logging
HWInfo - System Log Diagnostics 1
In the sensor window, press F2 or click the "Logging Start" button (a small
disk icon with a red dot).
Choose a location to save the log file (CSV format).
Click Save to start logging.
4.Let HWInfo Run in the Background
Keep HWInfo running while using your computer normally to capture
system events.
The program will continuously log sensor data to the CSV file.
5.Capture a System Issue
The goal is to log a crash or performance issue, even if it's temperature￾related.
If monitoring over a long period, adjust the logging interval in Settings →
Safety → Logging Interval (default is 1000ms).
6.Send Us the Log File
Once you've experienced a system issue, email the saved CSV file to the
support mailbox (for example, **support@example.com**).
The engineering team will analyze the logs to help diagnose the problem and
will follow up with a report.
