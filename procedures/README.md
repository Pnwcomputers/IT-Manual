This directory is dedicated to housing all **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**—the detailed, step-by-step guides for executing repeatable tasks and essential maintenance activities across the IT environment.

The goal is to ensure **consistency, quality, and accuracy** in performing all technical operations, regardless of which team member is executing the task.
