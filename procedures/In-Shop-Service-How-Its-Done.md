# In-Shop Service: How It's Done

## General Process

A well-structured check-in process for in-shop customer interactions ensures professionalism, efficiency, and a positive customer experience. Below is a general outline of the process from client arrival and check-in, to payment and parting ways.

---

## 1. Arrival and Greeting

### Professional Introduction
Greet the client with a friendly introduction, mentioning your name and company.

**Example**: *"Hi, I'm [Your Name] from Pacific Northwest Computers. We have an appointment to help you with your computer/tech issues!"*

### Confirm Appointment and Service
Briefly confirm the service details to ensure alignment and clarity on the work expected.

**Example**: *"So we are here to help figure out and hopefully fix your network issue and perform some system diagnostics, correct?"*

### Take Down Client Information and Pertinent Job Information

Collect the client's:
- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Date of Drop Off

**Document all peripherals being dropped off:**
- Any bags
- Power cord/cable
- Wireless mouse and/or keyboard
- Box of parts, system manual, info/password sheet, etc.

**Obtain all necessary login information:**
- System login password or PIN
- Needed account username and password information (email, Office 365, etc.)
- Administrator credentials

**Availability for questions:**
- Ask if they will be available for questions if/as needed
- Note on the check-in form when is the best time to contact the client

## 2. Service Explanation

### Review Problem or Request
Ask the client to provide any additional details or updates regarding the issue since the original request.

### Explain the Process
Give a brief overview of what will be done.

**Example**: *"I'll need to check the network configuration, run some diagnostics, and test the connection."*

### Turn Around Times

**Diagnostics**: 2-3 days in general

**Repair Work**: Additional 3-5 days may be needed for completing more involved services

**Note**: Jobs can go faster, and we're sometimes able to complete jobs same-day or next-day. We would rather give a longer turnaround time estimate and come through faster, than things be the other way around.

- If a job goes faster than expected, we will reach out ASAP
- If parts need to be ordered, we will provide the client with an estimated cost and shipping times as part of the diagnostics process

### Ask for Necessary Access
Ensure you obtain any and all necessary access to the system, passwords, or administrator credentials. If needed, ask if they will be available for questions and note when is the best time to contact them.

## 3. Perform the Service

### Work Efficiently
Perform the repair, installation, or diagnostics as per the service request. Keep organized, ensuring minimal disruption.

**If you finish quicker than expected**: Assess if there is anything you can check/address to maximize the repair time the customer is paying for.

**Important**: This does not apply to hardware-related repairs, unless other damage/necessary work has been identified. In which case we would inform our customer and get approval for any further/needed work.

**⚠️ DO NOT DO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT/OTHER JOBS WITHOUT APPROVAL!**

### Provide Updates

**If the task takes longer than expected**:
- Occasionally update the client on progress
- Explain the what/why of what is going on
- Explain what you are trying to do to finish the task as quickly as possible

**Be honest about limitations**: If the client's computer is old/slow, or the system only has USB 1.0 ports, don't hesitate to explain that their system/setup is contributing to the lack of progress.

**Preferred Communication Methods**: SMS/Text and Email
- Helps save valuable time that can be lost in phone conversations
- Provides written history for past communication, quotes, estimate pricing, work approvals, cautions given, etc.

### Document the Process
Take notes or document any major actions or changes made (e.g., replaced hardware, software reinstalled, settings reconfigured).

### Upselling
See: [Upselling Guide](../business/Upselling.md) - How to and ways to upsell recommended products and services.

## 4. Test and Demonstrate

### Test the Work
Once the job is completed, test the system, hardware, or network to ensure the problem is resolved.

### Demonstrate to the Client
Show the client what was done and demonstrate that the system is functioning properly.

**Example**: *"Here's your network speed now, and it's running as expected."*

### Answer Questions
Be ready to answer any questions the client might have about the work performed or provide instructions on using the new equipment/software.

---

## 5. Wrap-Up and Next Steps

### Provide Recommendations
If applicable, provide any recommendations for future maintenance or additional services.

**Example**: *"I recommend running regular malware scans."*

### Confirm Satisfaction
Ask the client if they're satisfied with the work or if they have any final concerns.

**Examples**:
- *"Is everything working as you expected?"*
- *"Is there anything else or do you have any other questions or issues?"*

---

## 6. Billing and Payment

### Review Costs
Go over the total cost of the service, explaining:
- Labor charges
- Parts used
- Trip fees (if applicable)
- Any other relevant fees

Present the client with a clear breakdown.

### Payment Collection
Collect payment via the agreed method:
- Cash
- Check
- Credit card
- PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, etc.

Provide a receipt if required or requested.

### Final Documentation
Offer any relevant documentation, such as service notes or a payment receipt.

## 7. Parting Ways

### Express Gratitude
Thank the client for choosing your services.

**Example**: *"Thank you for choosing Pacific Northwest Computers. We appreciate your business!"*

### Offer Further Assistance
Let the client know how to reach you for future assistance, reminding them of contact information or follow-up processes.

**Example**: *"Feel free to contact us if you need anything in the future."*

### Give Business Cards
Give the client a few business cards in case they need to reach out for any further help or support, and so they can give some cards away to friends and family!

### Part Ways Professionally
Thank the client for using our services, and let them know:

**Example**: *"I hope you don't have to reach back out to us too soon, but you know where to find us if you need us!"*

This structured approach ensures that client visits are handled professionally, thoroughly, and always remain customer-focused.
