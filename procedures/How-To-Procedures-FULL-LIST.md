## QuickBooks

### Quick Diagnostics & Repairs

**Server Network Profile:**
- Make sure the "Server" network profile is Private and NOT Public
- Ensure all Advanced Network Sharing options are on and Password Access is off

**Database Server Manager:**
- Make sure the QuickBooks Database Server Manager is running on the client's "Server" computer
- Select the "Scan" button when the program opens
- The scan itself can find and fix a large number of basic/minor issues with QuickBooks and QuickBooks network hosting

**QuickBooks Services:**
Make sure the QuickBooks Services (Run → Services.msc) are all set to start Automatically, and under their Recovery Tab (in Properties) make sure "Restart on Failure" is set for all 3 restart options, if the service(s) were to stop.

**QuickBooksDBXX**
- Service Name: `QuickBooksDB32` or `QuickBooksDBXX`
- Where XX = Year version of QuickBooks (e.g., `QuickBooksDB31` for QB 2021)

**QBCFMonitorService**
- Service Name: `QBCFMonitorService`

**Scheduled Task:**
Create a scheduled task in the Windows "Task Scheduler" to make sure the QuickBooks Database Server Manager application auto-starts for the following triggers:
- Computer Starts (1 minute delay)
- User Login (30 second delay)
- System wakes up from sleep
- System is Idle

---

### Advanced Diagnostics & Repairs

For a QuickBooks network setup, routine troubleshooting and repair procedures typically involve both network-level and QuickBooks-specific checks. These ensure proper file sharing, database server access, and multi-user functionality.

#### ✅ 1. Verify System & Network Requirements

- Make sure all systems (host/server and workstations) meet **QuickBooks system requirements**
- Confirm that **QuickBooks Desktop Database Server Manager** is installed and running on the host computer
- Ensure **Windows is up to date**, and **QuickBooks updates** are installed on all systems

#### ✅ 2. Check Folder Permissions

- The folder containing the company file (`.QBW`) must have full read/write permissions for all users who access it
- Right-click the folder > Properties > Security tab > ensure `Everyone` or `QBDataServiceUser` has Full Control
- Double-check that the **company file is shared** correctly on the network

#### ✅ 3. Run QuickBooks File Doctor Tool

- Download and run **QuickBooks Tool Hub** (from official Intuit support)
- Use **File Doctor** from the Tool Hub to scan and repair:
  - Company file corruption
  - Network connectivity issues

#### ✅ 4. Verify Hosting Settings

On each computer:
- Open QuickBooks > File > Utilities:
  - On the **server**, it should say **"Host Multi-User Access"**
  - On **workstations**, it should **not** say "Stop Hosting Multi-User Access." If it does, turn it off

#### ✅ 5. Use QuickBooks Database Server Manager

- Open **QuickBooks Database Server Manager** on the host computer
- Click **"Scan Folders"** and add the folder that contains the company files
- This creates proper `.ND` (network descriptor) files and allows the server to host the company files for multi-user access

#### ✅ 6. Check Windows Firewall and AV Software

Make sure firewall ports for QuickBooks are open:
- **TCP: 8019, 56728-56730** (for QuickBooks 2021–2024)

Also allow exceptions for:
- `QBDBMgrN.exe`
- `QBW32.exe`
- `FileManagement.exe`

Add exclusions in antivirus for the QuickBooks folder and services.

#### ✅ 7. Map a Network Drive (Optional but Recommended)

- Map a network drive to the folder containing the company file
- Use the mapped drive path (e.g., `Z:\CompanyFiles\YourCompany.QBW`) to open the file

#### ✅ 8. Check Services

On the host/server system:
- Open Services (`services.msc`) and ensure:
  - **QuickBooksDBXX** (XX = version year) is **Running** and set to **Automatic**
  - **QBCFMonitorService** is **Running**
- Restart services if needed

#### ✅ 9. Test Network Connectivity

- Try **pinging the server** by hostname from each workstation
- Use `\\ServerName\SharedFolder` to test access
- If this fails, check network sharing settings and any third-party security software

#### ✅ 10. Rebuild/Verify the Company File

- Open company file > File > Utilities > **Verify Data**
- If errors are found, run **Rebuild Data** from the same menu

#### ✅ 11. Multi-User Mode Test

- Open QuickBooks on multiple workstations
- Open the company file in **Multi-user Mode**
- Go to File > Switch to Multi-user Mode and test concurrent access

---

### 🚨 Common Errors You Might Encounter

- **H202, H505** – Network or hosting configuration issues
- **6000 series** – File access or corruption issues
- **6123** – Damaged .ND or .TLG files or connection failure

---

### 🛠 Tools You Should Use

- **QuickBooks Tool Hub** (includes File Doctor and other repair tools)
- **Database Server Manager**
- **Windows built-in tools** (Services, Firewall, Event Viewer)

### PowerShell Script - Fix QuickBooks Services Automatically

The following PowerShell script will check the status of the QuickBooks-related services on a Windows machine and starts them if they are stopped, but also sets their startup type to "Automatic" if it isn't already. This ensures the services will start on boot, which is especially helpful for a QuickBooks multi-user host/server setup.

```powershell
# PowerShell Script to check, start, and set QuickBooks services to Automatic
# Works with QuickBooks Desktop versions 2018–2024 (add more as needed)

# Define QuickBooks service names
$qbServices = @(
    "QuickBooksDB28", # QB 2018
    "QuickBooksDB29", # QB 2019
    "QuickBooksDB30", # QB 2020
    "QuickBooksDB31", # QB 2021
    "QuickBooksDB32", # QB 2022
    "QuickBooksDB33", # QB 2023
    "QuickBooksDB34", # QB 2024
    "QBCFMonitorService"
)

foreach ($serviceName in $qbServices) {
    $service = Get-Service -Name $serviceName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    
    if ($null -ne $service) {
        Write-Host "`nChecking service: $serviceName" -ForegroundColor Cyan
        
        # Set startup type to Automatic (if not already)
        $wmiService = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='$serviceName'"
        if ($wmiService.StartMode -ne "Auto") {
            Write-Host "-> Setting startup type to 'Automatic'..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
            $wmiService.ChangeStartMode("Automatic") | Out-Null
            Write-Host "✔ Startup type set to 'Automatic'." -ForegroundColor Green
        } else {
            Write-Host "✔ Startup type is already set to 'Automatic'." -ForegroundColor Green
        }
        
        # Start the service if it's not running
        if ($service.Status -ne 'Running') {
            Write-Host "-> Service is NOT running. Attempting to start..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
            Start-Service -Name $serviceName
            Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
            $updatedStatus = (Get-Service -Name $serviceName).Status
            
            if ($updatedStatus -eq 'Running') {
                Write-Host "✔ Service '$serviceName' started successfully." -ForegroundColor Green
            } else {
                Write-Host "✖ Failed to start service '$serviceName'." -ForegroundColor Red
            }
        } else {
            Write-Host "✔ Service '$serviceName' is already running." -ForegroundColor Green
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "⚠ Service '$serviceName' not found on this system." -ForegroundColor DarkYellow
    }
}

Write-Host "`n✅ All QuickBooks service checks complete." -ForegroundColor White
```

### 💡 How to Run This Script

1. **Copy and Paste** the code above into a fresh Notepad page/tab
2. **Save the script as:** `QB_Service_Check_AutoStart.ps1`
3. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click the script > Run with PowerShell
   - Or open PowerShell as Admin and run it manually
4. **Allow script execution if needed:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
