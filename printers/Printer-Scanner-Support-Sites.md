# 🖨️ Printer & Scanner Support Sites

**⚠️ Word of Warning:** Always **avoid downloading drivers from unofficial sources** or by using "driver update" tools or software (unless from the manufacturer)! Third-party "driver update" apps and software are almost **ALWAYS unsafe, and ALWAYS unnecessary!**
