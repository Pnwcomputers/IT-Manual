## Setup/Connect Printer to Wi-Fi

*(Note: The detailed steps for connecting the printer itself to Wi-Fi—usually done via the printer's control panel or a setup app—are not provided in the source text, but this step is assumed to be completed first.)*

## Static IP/Hostname Setup

2.  Choose **Add a printer using the printer’s Static TCP/IP address or its Hostname**.
3.  Enter the printer’s **Static IP** or **Hostname** and follow the prompts to install the printer driver.
4.  *(Optional):* Download and install the needed drivers and software directly from the appropriate manufacturer’s support website.
