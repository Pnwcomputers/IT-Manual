## 📖 About This Handbook
This repository is designed to equip field technicians and bench engineers with standard operating procedures (SOPs), troubleshooting workflows, and quick-reference checklists. It replaces "tribal knowledge" with documented standards to ensure consistent service delivery. My hope is for it to serve as a centralized knowledge base for IT professionals providing:

- Diagnostic and repairs support
- On-site services
- Customer communications
- Tools and software references
- Best practices for quality service delivery

## 💡 Philosophy

> "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so." - Mark Twain

> "In technology, mastery is an illusion. There's only the pursuit of understanding. After 20 years, I'm still learning every day. I don't claim to know it all, only to give it my all." - Jon-Eric Pienkowski

> "There are no mistakes; only opportunities for improvement."
