## Windows Built-in Backup (Local Backup)

### Windows Backup / OneDrive

* **Function:** Windows provides native utilities for local backups (often referred to as File History or Backup and Restore on older versions) that save copies of your files to an external drive.
* **OneDrive Integration:** On modern Windows systems, user files (Desktop, Documents, Pictures) are often automatically synchronized to **OneDrive**, providing a redundant, cloud-backed copy of the data.
* **Restoration:** Data can be restored directly from the external backup drive or by signing into the associated Microsoft account to retrieve files from OneDrive.

## ☁️ Online Backup Services / Ransomware Protection

Cloud-based backup services provide off-site data protection, crucial for comprehensive disaster recovery and defense against data loss scenarios.

* **Ransomware Defense:** Cloud backups are typically isolated from the active computer, meaning ransomware cannot encrypt the remote backups, providing a clean recovery point.
* **Disaster Recovery:** Protects data against physical loss (theft, fire) where local backups would also be destroyed.
* **Recommendation:** Utilize an online service (e.g., Backblaze, CrashPlan, IDrive) to supplement your local backups, adhering to the **3-2-1 backup rule** (3 copies of data, on 2 different media types, with 1 copy off-site).
