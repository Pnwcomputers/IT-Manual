# 💳 In-Shop PC Check-Out & Payments

This procedure covers the final steps for completed systems, including payment processing and client documentation at the shop.

## 1. Documentation

1.  Each completed system will have either a **printed invoice** or a **handwritten work order** with the total amount due attached to the system.
2.  **Cash Payments (Receipt):** If the payment is Cash, you can make a photocopy of the handwritten work order to serve as their receipt (any digital Invoice will be deleted), or use an iOS/Android CamScan app to email a copy to the customer.
3.  **Security Work:** If the customer had any security work performed or if we installed any security software, provide them with a **"Software Description" tip sheet** at checkout.

## 2. Payment Collection & Processing

We can collect or process payment via **Check, Online Payments (Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Zelle), Credit Card (all types accepted via Square), or Cash.**

### Credit Card (Square App)
1.  Use the **Square app** to process the payment.
2.  After processing, offer to send a receipt of the transaction via **SMS/Text or Email** to the client. (See **💳 Payment Processing** documentation for full details).

### Cash Payments
1.  **Discount:** If a customer pays with Cash, provide a **discount on the taxes** (remove the taxes due from the total amount due for Cash payments).
2.  **Cash Handling:** All received cash goes in the **Cash Box** (located in the upper-right desk drawer in the Main Office) with a **note of who paid and how much**.
