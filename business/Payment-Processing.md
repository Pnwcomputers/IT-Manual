## Payment Processing How-To (Square POS)

### Preparation
1.  Remember to include any supplies/materials (Flash Drive, Ext HDD, Ethernet Cable, etc.).
2.  Remember to include the applicable trip/travel fee.
3.  Remember to include the **5% processing fee** if a credit card or online payment method is used!

### Square POS - Process a Payment

1.  Open the Square App and enter your 4-digit PIN.
2.  Select **"Keypad"** (at the top of the app).
3.  Enter the total billable amount.

#### A. Calculating Labor Charge:

* We charge a **1-hour minimum charge**.
* If the job goes over an hour, we charge in **10-minute increments**.
    * *Example: $1\text{ hour } 20\text{ minutes}$*
    * 1. Divide total minutes over the initial hour by 60: $20 / 60 = 0.33$
    * 2. Add the initial hour to your calculated time: $1 + 0.33 = 1.33$
    * 3. Multiply by the hourly rate (e.g., $1.33 \times 100 = \$133$).

#### B. Calculating Final Total:

1.  **Subtotal:** Add labor charges to any other charges (travel fee, supplies used, etc.).
2.  **Tax/Processing Rate:**
    * **Cash/Check:** Multiply Subtotal by the applicable **sales tax rate only** (e.g., $0.088$).
    * **Card/Online:** Multiply Subtotal by the **combined rate** (Tax rate $+ 0.05$). *Example: Subtotal $\times 0.137$* (using $8.8\%$ tax rate example).
3.  **Billable Total:** Add the calculated processing/sales tax total to your subtotal amount.

### Receipt and Confirmation
* **Receipt:** Ask the client if they prefer an SMS or Email receipt, get their contact information, and input it into the Square App. Make sure the receipt sends successfully.
* **Online Payment Confirmation:** If an online payment method is used, ensure:
    * A payment confirmation is received and/or visible on their device.
    * The confirmation has the **correct total** and **username/payment destination** listed.
* **Verification:** If you have ANY doubts, contact Jon directly by phone, text, Chat, or email to confirm the payment has gone through successfully.
