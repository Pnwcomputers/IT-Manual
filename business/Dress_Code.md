## General Guidelines

1.  **Professional Attire:** Employees are expected to wear clothing that is appropriate for a business setting. This typically means **business casual attire** unless specified otherwise.
2.  **Personal Hygiene:** Maintain good personal hygiene. This includes regular bathing, using deodorant, and having clean, neat hair.
3.  **Grooming:** Hair should be clean and styled neatly. Facial hair should be well-groomed and trimmed.

## Onsite Specific General Guidelines

* **Business Casual:** Includes slacks, khakis, skirts, dress shirts, blouses, polos, and dresses. Avoid jeans, shorts, and T-shirts unless specified for specific jobs or casual days.
* **Footwear:** Closed-toe shoes are generally preferred. Avoid wearing flip-flops or overly casual sandals/shoes. **Sneakers are acceptable** if they are clean and not overly worn.
* **Accessories:** Keep accessories professional and minimal. Avoid overly flashy or distracting jewelry, especially if those accessories interfere with your job. **No long/low hanging necklaces or bracelets.**
* **Perfume and Cologne:** Use sparingly to avoid overwhelming scents that could disturb clients.
* **Makeup:** Should be professional and moderate.
* **Tattoos and Piercings:** Tattoos and piercings are absolutely okay! Anything obscene or offensive (tattoos or jewelry designs) will need to be covered or minimized the best as possible, especially with the job position being a customer-facing role.

### Casual Onsite Jobs (if applicable)

* **Jeans:** Clean, not ripped or overly distressed.
* **T-Shirts & Hats:** Avoid graphic tees/hats with offensive or overly casual prints or designs.

## Seasonal Guidelines

* **Summer:** Lightweight fabrics and short sleeves may be acceptable. However, avoid overly casual or beachwear-like attire.
* **Winter:** Professional sweaters and layers are acceptable. Avoid overly casual hoodies or outerwear.

## Exceptions and Accommodations

* **Religious and Cultural Attire:** We will always be respectful and allow for religious and cultural dress codes.
* **Health and Safety:** We do allow for exceptions where necessary for health and safety reasons, such as wearing specific footwear or clothing.

## Enforcement and Flexibility

* **Enforcement:** The consequences for not adhering to the dress code will start with up to **two verbal warnings**. Disciplinary action will then escalate to suspension from work, and then move to formal disciplinary actions such as being fired if an employee refuses to adhere to the dress code.
* **Flexibility:** We are always open to feedback and willing to adjust the guidelines based on employee needs and comfort, as well as evolving industry standards! So feel free to make recommendations and suggestions!
