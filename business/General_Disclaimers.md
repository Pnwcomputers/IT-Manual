## 🥉 3rd Party Software Support/Disclaimer

While we strive to provide comprehensive support for various software and products, it's important to note that we are not official representatives of these software/product providers. Therefore, our ability to address certain issues may be limited.

### Responsibility and Limits

* Product and Software Providers are ultimately responsible for the functionality of their product/service and they ultimately would need to be the ones to provide any kind of permanent fix, or be the ones to provide the information/instruction for a permanent fix.
* It can sometimes rely solely on the software/product provider to be able to fix and address issues, as it is their product/service.
* We can certainly help with general troubleshooting and provide guidance to the best of our ability.

### Recommendation

* For specific functionality, performance issues, or other detailed inquiries related to the product, we recommend contacting the official support channels of the software/product provider. They are ultimately responsible for ensuring the proper functionality and performance of their products and are best equipped to provide the necessary support.

### Paid Assistance

* We can also be hired to come out and work with any product/software vendor’s/provider's technical support directly on your behalf, and help you hold vendors/providers accountable for their product or service issues!
