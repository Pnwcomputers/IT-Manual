# Dispute Resolution

Employee dispute resolution refers to the processes and mechanisms used to address and resolve conflicts or disagreements between an employer and an employee.

---

## 1. Open Door Policy

We encourage open communication between employees and management and will always allow employees to voice concerns or grievances directly to their supervisors or management.

---

## 2. Grievance Procedures

### a. Legal Compliance

We ensure all dispute resolution processes will comply with applicable employment laws, regulations, and company policies.

### b. Informal Resolution

We encourage employees to first attempt to resolve grievances informally by discussing the issue with their immediate supervisor or manager. This step aims to address concerns quickly and informally.

### c. Formal Grievance Filing

If an issue cannot be resolved informally, we ask employees to file a written grievance, either in writing or via SMS/Email. The grievance should include details such as:

* The nature of the grievance
* Relevant dates
* Names of involved parties
* Desired resolution

### d. Investigation

We will conduct a thorough investigation into the grievance, which may involve interviewing relevant parties, gathering evidence, and reviewing pertinent documents.

### e. Decision

After considering all relevant information, a decision will be made and communicated in writing to the employee and any other involved parties. The decision will include the rationale for all decisions and any actions to be taken.

### f. Non-Retaliation

We ensure that employees feel protected against retaliation for filing grievances in good faith, as retaliation is prohibited under employment laws. We will **NEVER** judge, belittle, or hold a grudge against an employee who makes a complaint.

## 3. Conflict Resolution Training

We will provide training for managers and employees on conflict management techniques, communication skills, and effective negotiation to prevent and address disputes constructively.

---

## 4. Documentation

We will maintain accurate records of all communications, meetings, and decisions related to the dispute resolution process for legal and administrative purposes.

---

## 5. Follow-Up

We will monitor the outcomes of dispute resolutions to ensure compliance with agreed-upon solutions and to prevent recurrence of similar issues.
