    * Check your email for any security alerts or notifications from the service.
    * Follow any instructions provided to unlock or verify your account.
2.  **Ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is Working:**

## Step 3: Device and System Checks

1.  **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure your device is connected to the internet by visiting a few websites.
2.  **Ensure Date and Time Settings are Correct:** Incorrect time settings can cause login issues due to secure connection errors.
    * **Windows:** Go to $\text{Settings} \rightarrow \text{Time \& Language} \rightarrow \text{Date \& time}$. Enable **Set time automatically** and **Set time zone automatically**.
    * **macOS:** Go to $\text{System Settings} \rightarrow \text{Date \& Time}$. Enable **Set date and time automatically**.

## Step 4: Browser Troubleshooting

1.  **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:**
    * **Chrome:** $\text{Settings} \rightarrow \text{Privacy and security} \rightarrow \text{Clear browsing data}$.
    * **Firefox:** $\text{Options} \rightarrow \text{Privacy \& Security} \rightarrow \text{Cookies and Site Data} \rightarrow \text{Clear Data}$.
    * **Edge:** $\text{Settings} \rightarrow \text{Privacy, search, and services} \rightarrow \text{Clear browsing data}$.
2.  **Disable Browser Extensions:** Extensions can sometimes interfere with login processes.
    * Disable all extensions and try logging in again.
    * *Tip: Use an incognito or private browsing window to log in.*
3.  **Update Browser:** Ensure your web browser is up to date (check the browser’s settings or "About" page for updates).
4.  **Disable VPN and Proxy:** Disable any VPN or proxy settings and try logging in again.
