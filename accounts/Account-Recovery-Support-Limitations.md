# 🔓 Account Recovery Support; and Limitations

We completely understand how stressful it can be to lose access to your accounts, and we are here to assist our clients in any way we can!

## Our Role and Limitations

While we don't have any direct power or authority to recover accounts on a client’s behalf, since we are not an official representative of the compromised companies/accounts, we can help to **guide you through the available recovery processes step by step.**

The ability to regain access to your accounts will ultimately depend on the **recovery and backup methods that were set up prior** to the account being compromised.

For example, things like **recovery email addresses, phone numbers, or security questions will be key** to the process.

## Our Commitment

Though we are not able to guarantee success with regaining access to your accounts, we will absolutely do our best to **support you through the process** and provide guidance to help maximize your chances of regaining access!
