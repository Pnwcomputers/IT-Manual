# 🪲 Check for Malware and Adware

This procedure outlines the necessary steps for running full system scans and checking for common browser hijacks.

## I. Windows Secutity Check & Clean-up

Run **FULL scans** using the following tools to detect and remove common malware, adware, and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs):

* **ADWCleaner**
* **Malwarebytes Antimalware**
* **Local AV** (Antivirus software already installed on the system)

If the system is **badly infected**, run a **FULL scan** with:

* **Spybot Search and Destroy**

### Advanced Malware Cleaning Tools (For Heavily Infected Systems)

For persistent or severe infections, consider using these specialized tools:

* [Microsoft Defender Offline/Safety Scanner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/safety-scanner-download)
* [HitmanPro](https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/downloads)
* [Sophos Virus Removal Tool](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/free-tools/virus-removal-tool)
* [ESET Online Scanner](https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/?srsltid=AfmBOoqlLc8vOZjHRzJvrKcJFHpwNe_Cx6jrEnFUEr9M0jtYRDWpxPcb)

## II. macOS: Malware and Antivirus Tools (ClamXAV or MBAM)

Macs are vulnerable to adware and PUPs. Use the following tools to detect and remove Mac-specific threats.

### 1. Malwarebytes for Mac (MBAM)

* **Action:** Download the official installer for **Malwarebytes for Mac**. 
* **Procedure:** Install and run a **Full Scan**. This is highly effective at finding macOS-specific adware, PUPs, and browser hijackers that may not be caught by generic Windows tools.

### 2. ClamXAV

* **Action:** Download and install **ClamXAV**.
* **Procedure:** Open the application and navigate to the **Source List** to select the appropriate items for scanning (e.g., the User Folder or the entire Macintosh HD). Run a **Full Scan**.
* **Note:** ClamXAV uses the open-source ClamAV engine and is particularly strong at detecting malware (including Windows malware files stored on the Mac) and is often preferred for its lightweight resource usage.

## III. 🌐 Browser Hijack Checks

Check all installed web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) for the following common issues, which often indicate adware or malicious extensions.

* **Check 1: Malicious Extensions:**
    * **Action:** Navigate to the browser's **Extension/Add-on Manager**. Remove any unexpected, unwanted, or suspicious extensions. **If in doubt, disable or remove it.**
* **Check 2: Search Engine Hijacks:**
    * **Action:** Check the browser's **Settings** or **Preferences** for the **Default Search Engine**. Reset it to the desired provider (Google, Bing, etc.) and remove any malicious entries.
* **Check 3: Start Page Hijacks:**
    * **Action:** Check the browser's settings for the **Home Page** or **Start-up Page**. Ensure it is set to a blank page or a legitimate site.
* **Check 4: Notification Hijacks:**
    * **Action:** Check the browser's **Site Permissions** or **Privacy/Security Settings** for **Notifications**. Revoke permissions for any suspicious websites that are spamming the user with pop-ups.

## IV. Post-Cleanup & Reference

* **Clear Caches:** After removing malware/adware, run a utility like **BleachBit (Windows)** or **OnyX (Mac)** (refer to the previous guide) to clear residual cache files left by the malicious applications.
* **Blog Article Reference (For Redirect Issues):**
    * *External Blog Resource Example:* **Browser Redirect Virus Fix** – replace with any equivalent vetted article that explains how to reverse browser hijacks.
