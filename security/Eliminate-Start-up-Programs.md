## Accessing the Startup List

You can access and manage the list of programs that launch automatically using either of these built-in Windows methods:

* **Task Manager:** Open Task Manager ($\text{Ctrl} + \text{Shift} + \text{Esc}$) and navigate to the **Startup** tab.
* **System Settings:** Open **Settings** ($\text{Windows} + \text{I}$) and go to the **Startup Apps** section.

## ⛔ Programs to Disable

You should **disable pretty much everything** in the startup list, as most programs do not need to run immediately when the computer starts.

## ✅ Programs to Keep Enabled

Only keep the following categories of software enabled at startup:

* **Security Software:** Your primary Antivirus or Malware protection.
* **Wireless, Audio, Device Apps:** Essential drivers or control panel software for hardware (e.g., sound card, GPU control).
* **Printer/Scanner Software:** If you need quick access to scanning or status monitoring.
* **Synchronization Apps:**
    * iCloud Drive, Google Drive
    * OneDrive (\*If actively needed for file sync)
* **Fitness/Device Sync Apps:**
    * Garmin GPS App
    * Fitbit
    * *Etc.*
* **Online or Local Backup Apps:** Essential for ensuring scheduled backups run correctly.
