# 🍎 Data Backup/Restore (Mac)

This section covers essential methods for backing up and restoring data on macOS, focusing on local and cloud solutions.

## Time Machine (Local Backup)

**Time Machine** is the built-in backup feature of macOS that works with an external drive (HDD/SSD) connected to your Mac.

* **Function:** It creates incremental backups of your files, applications, system files, and settings.
* **Restoration:** You can restore your entire system, specific folders, or individual files from any point in the backup timeline.
* **Recommendation:** Set up Time Machine immediately upon setting up a new Mac to ensure a recovery point is always available.

## ☁️ Online Backup Services / Ransomware Protection

Online (cloud-based) backup services provide off-site data protection, which is essential for comprehensive disaster recovery and defense against data loss scenarios like:

* **Physical Theft or Fire:** Local backups (like Time Machine) are vulnerable if kept near the computer.
* **Ransomware:** Cloud backups are typically isolated from your active computer, meaning ransomware cannot encrypt the remote backups, providing a clean recovery point.

**Recommendation:** Utilize a service (like Backblaze, Carbonite, or similar) to complement your Time Machine backup, adhering to the **3-2-1 backup rule** (3 copies of data, on 2 different media types, with 1 copy off-site).
