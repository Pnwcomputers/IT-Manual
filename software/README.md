## 🔒 Security and Compliance

Software management is a critical security function:

* **Vetting Process:** All new software requests must go through a documented security review process before being added to the `approved_software_list.md`.
* **Patching Priority:** Security patches must be prioritized and deployed according to the `software_update_patching_policy.md` to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
* **Legal Compliance:** Strict adherence to the `license_management_guide.md` prevents legal exposure from software piracy or under-licensing.
