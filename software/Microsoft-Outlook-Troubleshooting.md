## 1. Verifying Account Access and Licenses

The primary method for confirming a user owns a Microsoft Office license is checking their Microsoft Account.

1.  **Access Account:** Log in to the user’s Microsoft Account via **`www.office.com`**.
2.  **Reset Password (If needed):** If the user cannot log in, go through the **"Forgotten Password"** process. This process may include:
    * Answering Security Questions.
    * Receiving a code texted to an associated cellphone.
    * Receiving a reset code/instructions sent to a recovery email address.
3.  **Check Subscriptions/Purchases:** Once logged into the Microsoft Account, look up **past purchases and current subscriptions** to find and install/reinstall any needed Microsoft Office software.
    * **Note:** If a subscription or purchase is not listed, another Microsoft account may have been used for the purchase and licensing.

## 2. Verifying Account on an Existing System

If the client already has a system with their Office software installed and working, you can quickly verify the registered account:

* Open **any Office program** (Word, Excel, etc.).
* Click on the **Account button** in the upper right corner (typically near the minimize/maximize/close buttons). The registered email address will be displayed there.

## 3. License Key Information

If a reinstallation requires a license key:

* If the Office software was purchased from a **"Big Box" store**, the license key is typically found on the **receipt**, or the seller will provide a **license key card**.
