***Always Google search anything questionable/unknown!***

## Types of Software to Remove

### Registry Cleaners
Registry cleaners often cause more harm than good and can lead to system instability.

### Driver Update Software
Third-party driver updaters are typically unnecessary and can install incorrect or incompatible drivers.

### Off-Brand & "Rogue" Security Software
Fake or low-quality antivirus/security software that may actually be malware.

### Off-brand Performance Tune-up / File Clean-up Tools
Many of these tools are bloatware that don't provide real benefits and may slow down the system.

### Un-needed Browser Extensions/Add-Ons
Remove unnecessary browser extensions unless a customer specifies not to remove them.

3. **Document removals**: Keep track of what was removed in case issues arise later
4. **Educate customers**: Explain why certain software was removed to prevent reinstallation
