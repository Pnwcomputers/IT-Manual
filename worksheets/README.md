# 📋 Bench Worksheets & Checklists

**Part of the [IT-Manual](../README.md)**
*Printable forms and questionnaires for ensuring consistency on the repair bench.*

## 📖 Overview
This directory contains the physical (or fillable PDF) forms used during service. Unlike the digital "Procedures" in other folders, these files are designed to be printed out, attached to a clipboard, and traveled with the device as it moves through the shop. They ensure that every technician performs the same 15-point inspection, regardless of who is working that day.

### 🔧 Repair & Service Checklists (PDF)
*Print these out and attach them to the device ticket.*

- **[Diagnostics Work Order](./Diagnostics_Work_Order.pdf)**
  The standard intake checklist. Covers physical condition checks, initial boot tests, and hardware stress testing.
- **[Computer Clean-up Work Order](./Computer_Clean-up_Work_Order.pdf)**
  The "Tune-Up" checklist. Ensures the tech remembers to empty the Recycle Bin, update Windows, check for bloatware, and physically dust the fans.
- **[GPU Diagnostics Work Order](./GPU_Diagnostics_Work_Order.pdf)**
  A specialized checklist for testing graphics cards (stress testing, thermal monitoring, port checking). Critical for gaming PC repairs.
- **[New PC Setup To-Do List](./New_PC_Setup_To-Do_List.pdf)**
  The "Out of Box" checklist. Ensures every new computer sold gets the same standard treatment (Bloatware removed, updates run, Chrome installed).

### 🖥️ Custom Builds & Sales
*Intake forms for new sales.*

- **[Custom PC Questions](./CustomPC_Question.md)**
  **Client Questionnaire:** A list of questions to ask a customer who wants a custom computer built.
  * *Examples: "What resolution are you gaming at?", "Do you need WiFi?", "Do you care about RGB lighting?"*

## 🖊️ Usage: The "Traveler" System
*How to use these worksheets effectively in the shop.*

1.  **Intake:** When a machine is checked in, the front desk prints the relevant **Work Order PDF**.
2.  **Attachment:** The sheet is clipped to the device or taped to the case.
3.  **Execution:** As the technician completes steps (e.g., "Ran Malwarebytes"), they **initial the box** on the paper.
4.  **QC (Quality Control):** Before the device leaves, a second set of eyes reviews the sheet to ensure no boxes were skipped.
5.  **Digitization:** The completed sheet is scanned or photographed and uploaded to the ticket history for liability protection.
