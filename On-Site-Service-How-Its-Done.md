# On-Site Service: How It's Done

## General Process

A well-structured onsite visit by a field service technician ensures professionalism, efficiency, and a positive customer experience. Below is a general outline of the process from arrival to payment and parting ways.

---

## 1. Arrival and Greeting

### Prompt Arrival
Arrive at the client's location on time. If delayed, inform the client in advance.

### Professional Introduction
Greet the client with a friendly introduction, mentioning your name and company.

**Example**: *"Hi, I'm [Your Name] from Pacific Northwest Computers. We have an appointment to help you with your computer/tech issues!"*

### Confirm Appointment and Service
Briefly confirm the service details to ensure alignment and clarity on the work expected.

**Example**: *"So we are here to help figure out and hopefully fix your network issue and perform some system diagnostics, correct?"*

### Assess the Area
- Politely ask if shoes on or off is preferred
- Ask to be shown the area where the work will be done and invite the customer to lead the way
- If any tools or equipment need to be brought in, ask if it's okay to do so and where a good place for them would be

## 2. Service Explanation and Setup

### Review Problem or Request
Ask the client to provide any additional details or updates regarding the issue since the original request.

### Explain the Process
Give a brief overview of what will be done.

**Example**: *"I'll need to check the network configuration, run some diagnostics, and test the connection."*

### Ask for Necessary Access
Ensure you have the necessary access to the system, passwords, or administrator credentials. If needed, ask if they will be available for questions during the process.

## 3. Perform the Service

### Work Efficiently
Perform the repair, installation, or diagnostics as per the service request. Keep organized, ensuring minimal disruption to the client's environment. 

**Pro Tip**: If you finish quicker than expected, ask the client if there is anything else you can address or offer to do a general clean-up, tune-up, and assessment.

### Provide Updates
- **If the task takes longer than expected**: Occasionally update the client on progress and explain the what/why of what is going on. Explain what you are trying to do to finish the task as quickly as possible.
- **If factors are slowing progress**: If the client's internet is slow, their computer is old/slow, or maybe the system only has USB 1.0 ports—don't hesitate to be honest and explain that their system/setup/internet/etc. is contributing to the lack of progress.

### Document the Process
Take notes or document any major actions or changes made (e.g., replaced hardware, software reinstalled, settings reconfigured).

### Upselling Opportunities
See [Upselling Guide](./Upselling.md) for how to and ways to upsell recommended products and services.

## 4. Test and Demonstrate

### Test the Work
Once the job is completed, test the system, hardware, or network to ensure the problem is resolved.

### Demonstrate to the Client
Show the client what was done and demonstrate that the system is functioning properly.

**Example**: *"Here's your network speed now, and it's running as expected."*

### Answer Questions
Be ready to answer any questions the client might have about the work performed or provide instructions on using the new equipment/software.

## 5. Wrap-Up and Next Steps

### Provide Recommendations
If applicable, provide any recommendations for future maintenance or additional services.

**Example**: *"I recommend running regular malware scans."*

### Confirm Satisfaction
Ask the client if they're satisfied with the work or if they have any final concerns.

**Examples**:
- *"Is everything working as you expected?"*
- *"Is there anything else or do you have any other questions or issues?"*

### Clean Up
- Ensure the work area is left clean and free of any debris or equipment
- Return the workspace to how it was before the service
- Offer to help dispose of any trash, recycling, etc.

## 6. Billing and Payments

### Review Costs
Go over the total cost of the service, explaining labor charges, parts used, trip fees, and any other relevant fees. Present the client with a clear breakdown.

### Payment Collection
See [Payment Processing](./Payment-Processing.md) for full details.

**Accepted methods**: Cash, check, credit card, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, etc.

### Provide a Receipt
Always provide a receipt for the service.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT PAYMENT
**DO NOT LEAVE A JOB WITHOUT COLLECTING PAYMENT!** You will not receive payment for work completed unless/until the client has paid for their service.

### Final Documentation
Offer any relevant documentation, such as service notes or a payment receipt.

## 7. Parting Ways

### Express Gratitude
Thank the client for choosing your services.

**Example**: *"Thank you for choosing Pacific Northwest Computers. We appreciate your business!"*

### Offer Further Assistance
Let the client know how to reach you for future assistance, reminding them of contact information or follow-up processes.

**Example**: *"Feel free to contact us if you need anything in the future."*

### Leave Business Cards
Give the client a few business cards just in case they need to reach out for any further help or support, and so they can give some cards away to friends and family!

### Exit Professionally
Leave the site professionally and promptly, ensuring you've gathered all tools and equipment.
