# 📝 Our Service Guarantee

This guarantee applies to all repair and service work performed.

---

## 1. Guarantee Period
All repair work is guaranteed for **14 days** from the date the computer was picked up, or from the date when the work was completed.

## 2. Unresolved Issues
If an initially reported problem or issue was not corrected during the repair, and the computer exhibits the **exact same symptoms** as when first brought in, the service provider will make every attempt to fix that problem at **no extra labor cost** to the client.

* **Escalated Issues ("New Problem" Rule):** If the initial problem is not remedied by routine procedures and **additional, non-standard labor** is needed (e.g., escalating from software repair to hardware replacement), additional charges may apply. All options will be communicated before proceeding.

## 3. Transparency and Client Authority
The service provider will always be clear about all routes of repair and their potential outcomes at the time of service. What repairs are performed are **always the customer's decision**, and upselling is never forced.

## 4. Reporting Problems
Customers need to contact the service provider **ASAP** when it is determined that a problem still exists. Over time, problems can get worse.

* Even if you cannot bring the system in right away, please **notify the service provider within that 14-day period** to honor the guarantee.
