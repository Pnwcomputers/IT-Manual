# 🥉 3rd Party Software Support/Disclaimer

While we strive to provide comprehensive support for various software and products, it's important to understand the limits of our assistance when dealing with $3\text{rd}$ party vendors.

## Limits of Our Support

We are **not official representatives** of software or product providers. Therefore, our ability to address certain issues may be limited.

* **Vendor Responsibility:** Product and Software Providers are **ultimately responsible** for the functionality of their product/service. They are the ones who must provide any kind of permanent fix or the instructions for one.
* **Recommendation:** For specific functionality, performance issues, or detailed inquiries related to a $3\text{rd}$ party product, we **recommend contacting the official support channels** of that software/product provider. They are best equipped to provide the necessary support.

## How We Can Help

We can certainly help with **general troubleshooting** and provide **guidance** to the best of our ability.

We can also be hired to come out and **work with any product/software vendor’s technical support directly on your behalf**. This service helps you hold vendors/providers accountable for their product or service issues and is charged at the appropriate hourly rate.
