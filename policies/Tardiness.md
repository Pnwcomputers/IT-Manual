# Lateness/Tardiness Policy

Our late policy for field service technicians strives to balance fairness, accountability, and flexibility, considering the nature of your work and the impact of tardiness on customer satisfaction and team dynamics.

---

## General Policy

* **Punctuality Expectation:** Technicians are expected to arrive at the job site or office at the scheduled time, ready to begin work.
* **Grace Period:** A small grace period (e.g., **5-10 minutes**) is allowed before lateness is officially recorded. This acknowledges occasional minor delays without penalizing employees unduly.

## Reporting Late

1.  **Notification:** Technicians **must notify** their supervisor or dispatcher as soon as they know they will be late. This should be done by phone, text, or an internal communication system.
2.  **Reason for Lateness:** Technicians should provide a reason for their lateness to help the supervisor understand the situation and decide on appropriate actions.

## Consequences for Lateness

| Offense | Disciplinary Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **First Offense** | A **verbal warning** and a reminder of the importance of punctuality. |
| **Second Offense** | A **written warning** placed in the employee's file, potentially with a meeting to discuss reasons and underlying issues. |
| **Third Offense** | A more formal disciplinary action, such as a **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**, which outlines steps to correct the behavior. |
| **Continued Offenses** | Further disciplinary actions, which could include **suspension or termination**, depending on the severity and frequency of the lateness. |

## Mitigating Circumstances & Support

* **Consideration for Emergencies:** We will always do our best to understand and account for legitimate emergencies or unavoidable circumstances, such as severe weather, traffic accidents, or personal emergencies.
* **Flexible Solutions:** We can and will offer solutions such as adjusting start times temporarily or permanently if recurring lateness is due to factors outside the technician’s control.
* **Addressing Underlying Issues:** We will do our best to provide support for underlying issues causing lateness, such as transportation assistance, flexible scheduling, or personal counseling services.
* **Training and Awareness:** We will regularly remind technicians (but not nag) of the importance of punctuality and the impact of their timeliness.
* **Documentation:** All instances of lateness will be documented on the **Job Work Order** log entry, including the date, time of arrival, and reason for being late.

## Positive Reinforcement

* **Recognition:** We will also do our best to acknowledge and reward punctuality and consistent on-time performance through incentives, bonuses, or public recognition within the company.

## Policy Review and Feedback

* **Regular Review:** Periodically we will review the lateness policy to ensure it remains fair, effective, and aligned with company values and operational needs.
* **Employee Feedback:** We encourage and consider feedback from technicians to improve the policy and address any concerns they may have!
