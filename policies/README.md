## 📖 Overview
This directory houses the formal rules that define our relationship with clients and the behavioral standards for our staff. It includes the "Fine Print" regarding what we are liable for, as well as our promises regarding repair quality.

## 📂 Contents

### 🛡️ Client Guarantees & Liabilities
*What the client agrees to, and what we promise them.*

- **[Our Service Guarantee](./Our-Service-Guarantee.md)**
  **Sales Tool:** The written warranty policy. Defines the rework period (e.g., 30 days) and conditions under which a repair will be redone at no cost.
- **[3rd Party Software Support Disclaimer](./3rd-Party-Software-Support-Disclaimer.md)**
  **Critical Protection:** Explicitly states that we do not own, code, or license software (like QuickBooks, Outlook, or Adobe). We support the *installation*, not the *code*.
- **[Disclaimers](./Disclaimers.md)**
  General liability limits regarding data loss, unforeseen hardware failure during repair, and unclaimed property.
- **[Terms of Service](./Terms-of-Service.md)**
  The master agreement governing all work performed.

### 👥 Staff Standards
*Internal rules for employees.*

- **[Client Confidentiality Policies](./Client-Confidentiality-Policies.md)**
  **Zero Tolerance:** Rules regarding data privacy. Technicians must never access client files (photos, docs) unless explicitly required for data recovery, and must never discuss client data outside the shop.
- **[Tardiness](./Tardiness.md)**
  HR policy regarding shift start times, calling in sick, and consequences for repeated lateness.

## ⚡ Policy "Cheat Sheet"
*Key takeaways for quick reference during client disputes.*

| Issue | Policy Reference | Standard Stance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"You updated my Outlook and now it's buggy!"** | `3rd-Party-Software...` | "We configure the software, but we cannot fix bugs in Microsoft's code. You may need to wait for a patch." |
| **"The issue came back 2 weeks later."** | `Our-Service-Guarantee` | "Since it is within our warranty window, bring it back and we will re-diagnose it for free." |
| **"I lost data during the virus removal."** | `Disclaimers` | "As per the waiver signed at drop-off, we are not liable for data loss. We always recommend a backup." |
| **"Can you just copy these photos to your drive?"** | `Client-Confidentiality` | "I cannot store your personal data on my personal or shop machines due to our strict privacy policy." |
